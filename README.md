# so-solitario
SoSolitario is another simple solitaire game, it supports two kind of card decks: choose what you like more! 

## The game
Your first step in this game is to choose your favourite deck:

1. the poker deck 
2. the italian deck

Pay attention, the second deck has less cards than the first one, that means that if you're going to play with the second, the game will be easier. :relieved:

To start and play the only thing that you have to do, it's clicking on the deck in the top-right as you can see on the below image:

You will win if you are going to have only two cards showed of the entire deck.

In order to win you have to show the cards and check if through the cards showed on the table there are at least two cards with the same seeds or the same number (or both) with a distance of one card, in that case you can click on this two cards and the card in the middle will flow on the first one from the right to the left. 

Check the image below :smile:

If you get stuck with the game, you can use the tips button on the right-bottom, but it will be possible only if you have already seen all the cards!
