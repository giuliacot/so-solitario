# so-solitario
SoSolitario is another simple solitaire game, it supports two kind of card decks: choose what you like more! 

## The game
This solitaire game you have to start to choose your favourite deck:

1. the poker deck 
2. the italian deck

The second one has less cards than the first one, that means that if you're going to play with the second the game will be easier. :relieved:

To start and play the only thing that you have to do, it's to click on the deck as you can see on the below image:

What you have to achive is to have only two showed card of all the deck. 
You can do that showing card by card and ckeching if through the card showed on the table there are at least two cards with the same seeds or the same number with a distance of one card, in that case you can click on this two cards and the card in the middle will flow on the first one from the left to the right.
